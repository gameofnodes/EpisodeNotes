## Episode 126: I'm Not a Gangster, I'm a Businessman

While the babies (and SPF ports) keep us up at night, the GoN crew Demonstrates our Commitment and gets back to work discussing [@injective](https://x.com/injective)'s cash grab booth of Validator coupons at Token 2049, AIs rugging AIs, and the academic definition of shitcoin.
